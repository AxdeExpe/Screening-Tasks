# Screening Tasks Collection

This repository is a central collection of **all coding and data science screening tasks** that I have completed or plan to complete. It serves as a personal reference, a portfolio of practice exercises, and a way to track progress over time.

## Purpose

- **Practice & Learning**: Improve coding, data analysis, and problem-solving skills across different domains.
- **Portfolio**: Showcase solutions to potential interview screening tasks.
- **Reference**: Keep track of patterns, approaches, and reusable code snippets for future tasks.

This repository is **actively maintained** and intended as a personal growth and reference tool for coding interviews.
